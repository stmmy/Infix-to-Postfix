# Infix-to-Postfix
C++ algorithm to convert expressions from infix to postfix notation and also evaluates
an expression in postfix notation

Program reads input from terminal -

first argument dictates what alorithm you want to execute: 2 for infix to postfix conversion, 3 for postfix evaluation

second argument contains the expression

third argument is name of the output file

Ex. 2 "2-3*4+5/6" "itp.output"  converts 2-3*4+5/6 to postfix and produces the result in the file named itp.output

Ex. 3 "23+4^5*" "p.output" evaluates the postfix expression 23+4^5* and produces the result in the file named p.output
